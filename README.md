This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Overview

A relatively simple demonstration of drag and drop in React.  In the primary state clicking on the first two columns sorts
ascending (descending if you click again) the records according to their group.  Clicking on the custom column or choosing
Custom from the dropdown will open a different interface to allow you manually arrange the record grouping.  Forgive my
colors.
